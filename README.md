# 🧠 Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts

This project focuses on building a classification model to distinguish between introverts and extroverts using behavioral and demographic features.

## 📌 Project Overview
The dataset contains information about:

. Personality traits

. Social interaction patterns

. Demographics

. Other psychological indicators

The goal is to apply machine learning models to predict personality type (Introvert vs. Extrovert).
